> I respectfully acknowledge that UQAM is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of these lands and waters. Tiohtià:ke/Montréal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. I respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.
